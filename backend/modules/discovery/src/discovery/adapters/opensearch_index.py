"""OpenSearch read adapters — real ``VectorStoreAdapter`` + ``LexicalIndexAdapter``.

The reader mirror of U1's ``OpenSearchVectorIndex`` writer: the SAME index
(``docsuri-corpus-v1``), one store serving both k-NN (cosine, ``vector``) and BM25
(``title``/``abstract``/``lexicalTerms``) — hybrid retrieval (FR-2). Hits are
deserialized straight back into the shared ``IndexRecord`` (SSOT round-trip; no forked
shape). OpenSearch is one store, so ANY
query failure raises ``IndexUnavailable`` → the orchestrator fail-closes (INV-3/SEC-15);
there is no index fallback (only embedding has a fallback).

ports declares ``VectorStoreAdapter`` and ``LexicalIndexAdapter`` as two protocols; they are
exposed as two adapter objects but share one OpenSearch client via ``OpenSearchClientFactory``.
